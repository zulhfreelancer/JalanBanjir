Jalan Banjir Android App
========================

This is source code of [Jalan Banjir Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zulhilmizainudin.jalanbanjir). Developed using [Phonegap](http://phonegap.com).

Why I Developed This App?
-------------------------

Basically, the idea to built this app was pretty simple and spontaneous.

I got the idea to develop this app when I got stucked in KL for 2 days because Lebuhraya Pantai Timur (LPT) was flooded (in Temerloh) and I was unable to go back to my home in Kuantan.

I found that JKR Malaysia is helping people by sharing alternative routes from KL - Kuantan from their Twitter account.

That leads me to do in depth search to find more information about alternative routes from KL - Kuantan.

And, I found [this page](http://bencanaalam.jkr.gov.my/content.php?ida=&type=STAT&page=status) and [this page](http://mybanjir.com/). MyBanjir team was doing a great web apps and they created *Flooded Roads* section in that website.

They already created a scraper bot to fetch all data from JKR website.

So, I grabbed the MyBanjir scraper bot node URLs and start doing my first bootstrap app (naked & skeleton HTMLs) just to test some functionality & data manipulation that I want.

Finally, I grabbed jQuery Mobile as the UI framework (I'm using [Ratchet](http://goratchet.com/) at the early phase actually, but stucked with some problems) and binded all the tested codes inside it.

That's how I begin.

Thank you MyBanjir team & JKR for providing reputable data for us. This Jalan Banjir app might be not working soon if one of them is shutting down the services (this app dependencies).

Do let me know if the app breaks!

PS: I successfully touch down Kuantan from KL using this alternative routes:

KL - Seremban - Kuala Pilah - Muadzam - Gambang - Kuantan (that's 7 hours of long journey you know)

Thank You For Sharing
---------------------

I also would like to say thank you to you who helped me spreading words about this simple app.

I'm sure many people and flood volunteer team get benefits from this app.
