Jalan Banjir Android App
========================

This is source code of [Jalan Banjir Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zulhilmizainudin.jalanbanjir). Developed using [Phonegap](http://phonegap.com).

Why I Developed This App?
-------------------------

Basically, the idea to build this app was pretty simple and spontaneous.

I got the idea to develop this app when I got stucked in KL for 2 days because Lebuhraya Pantai Timur (LPT) was flooded (in Temerloh) and I was unable to go back to my home in Kuantan. Then I learned that JKR Malaysia is helping people by sharing alternative routes from KL - Kuantan on their Twitter account.

That led me to do in depth search to find more information about alternative routes from KL - Kuantan. I found [this page](http://bencanaalam.jkr.gov.my/content.php?ida=&type=STAT&page=status) and [this page](http://mybanjir.com/). MyBanjir team was doing a great web app and they created *Flooded Roads* section in that website. They also created a scraper bot to fetch all data from JKR website.

So, I grabbed the MyBanjir scraper bot node URLs and started doing my first bootstrap app (naked & skeleton HTMLs) just to test some functionalities & data manipulations. Finally, I grabbed jQuery Mobile as the UI framework (I'm using [Ratchet](http://goratchet.com/) at the early phase, but got stuck at some problems) and binded all the tested codes inside it.

That's how this app got created.

Thank you MyBanjir team & JKR for providing reputable data for us. This Jalan Banjir app might be not working if the services got shut down because this app is depending on those services.

Do let me know if the app breaks!

PS: I safely arrived at my home in Kuantan from KL using this alternative route:

KL - Seremban - Kuala Pilah - Muadzam - Gambang - Kuantan (that's 7 hours of long journey you know)

Thank You For Sharing
---------------------

I'd like to say thank you to those who helped me spreading words about simple app. I'm sure many people and flood volunteer team get benefits from this app.
